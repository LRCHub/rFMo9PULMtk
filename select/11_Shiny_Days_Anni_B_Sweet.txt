But it's only when you leave
That I'm feeling left alone
And you just walked out the door
Even, even start to moan

I said
"Baby, baby please
Don't you leave me sitting here
I've got a lot of imagination for horrible things"

You're ready in the car
You're on your way home
Well, I'm leaving you a message
On the telephone saying

"Oh, oh baby
Bring me my shiny days
Bring me my shiny days back"
And he said
"Oh, oh darling
Bring me my shiny days
And take away the rainy days"

And it's been three days gone
But you still have not come home
You've got a lot of work to do
You're a busy, busy man

But I'm still waiting for you
With the same love as before
Yes, I'm still waiting for you
To give me more and more

"Oh, oh baby
Bring me my shiny days
Bring me my shiny days back"
And he said
"Oh, oh darling
Bring me my shiny days
And take away the rainy days"
